<h2 id="actual-introduction">Actual Introduction</h2>
<p>So this site is my first dive into Hugo. A Go based Static Page generator, that allows blog posts to be source controlled via GitHub. The desire behind this is portability. You see, with the repo hosted in git, in theory, i could simply use whatever editor and git conection to upload blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>So a few years ago i wanted to start a blog. But the tools for Wordpress always left me wanting. Not to mention annoyed with all of the immediate spam when hosting your own. I liked the simplicity of blogger, but truthfully, it just didn&rsquo;t seem like a good use of my technology skills. That and the old Live Writer tool that i used has been somewhat sunsetted, and open live writer didn&rsquo;t exactly work as well as it once did.</p>
<p>So I looked for an editor that used markdown, and found several variants. Jeckyll built on Ruby was one of the primary interests i had. It was slick, clean, and fast. But Ruby is not particularly one of my favorite languages to work within. So the search continued. During my research though I found Hugo, which, is built on Go, and seemed to be a better, more universal fit for me.</p>
