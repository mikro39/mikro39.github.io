## Introduction

This post is the first post i have made using hugo on my macbook pro. The **Test's** purpose is to see how the markdown language builds into these posts. *emphasis*. hehe :)

## Actual Introduction
So this site is my first dive into Hugo. A Go based Static Page generator, that allows blog posts to be source controlled via GitHub. The desire behind this is portability. You see, with the repo hosted in git, in theory, i could simply use whatever editor and git conection to upload blog posts.

## Background
So a few years ago i wanted to start a blog. But the tools for Wordpress always left me wanting. Not to mention annoyed with all of the immediate spam when hosting your own. I liked the simplicity of blogger, but truthfully, it just didn't seem like a good use of my technology skills. That and the old Live Writer tool that i used has been somewhat sunsetted, and open live writer didn't exactly work as well as it once did.

So I looked for an editor that used markdown, and found several variants. Jeckyll built on Ruby was one of the primary interests i had. It was slick, clean, and fast. But Ruby is not particularly one of my favorite languages to work within. So the search continued. During my research though I found Hugo, which, is built on Go, and seemed to be a better, more universal fit for me.
