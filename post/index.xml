So a few changes as i am customizing this thing. Changed from the default theme - Sorry Hugo folks, it is nice, but hard to customize.
Setup For this project, i am using my M1 Macbook Pro with Visual Studio Code. I am deploying this site to GitHub Pages, and have a rudementary pipeline in place that builds using Hugo, the site and publishes to a branch that is published to the GitHub Page.</description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>http://www.mikeromero.us/post/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 19:19:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.mikeromero.us/post/my-first-post/</guid><description>Introduction This post is the first post i have made using hugo on my macbook pro. The Test&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to see how the markdown language builds into these posts. emphasis. hehe :)
Actual Introduction So this site is my first dive into Hugo. A Go based Static Page generator, that allows blog posts to be source controlled via GitHub. The desire behind this is portability. You see, with the repo hosted in git, in theory, i could simply use whatever editor and git conection to upload blog posts.</description></item></channel></rss>
